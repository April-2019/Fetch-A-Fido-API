# Fetch-a-Fido-API
Backend to a dog finding app for finding purebread dogs under strict guidelines

Goals for this project include...

-Paperwork Validation
-Login validation
-different kinds of relationships between dogs, puppies, breeders and owners
-A Pawesome-ly built API


This will only be the API for now. Care and attention are going to go into this particular part of the application

This backend will be using:

-Ruby on Rails
-GraphQL
-PostgreSQL
and anything else that may come up as I find new things to impliment (I will add them in as I add them if needed)

The frontend will be using React, with plans to use Redux. Once a repo has been created for the frontend the link will be posted here!
